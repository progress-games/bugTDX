How much money did my first game make on steam?

On the 16th of June 2023, I released bugTDX, a roguelike tower-defense game inspired by Bloons TD and Super Auto Pets. I initially thought the game flopped, however something happened, and the sales shot up. This is how much money my first game made on Steam. Plus, I’ll drop in some of my learnings on the way. 

I’d been developing bugTDX on-and-off for about 6 months. I mean it when I say this was my first ever game. Before this, all I created were little arcade games with no menus, and no colour. If you’re interested in making games yourself, or just curious about how bugTDX succeeded, this is the video for you.

Wishlists.

So, here’s the wishlist data on launch day. 

64 is objectively bad. Wishlist conversion rates are far lower than you'd expect - typically around 1-3%. From this, I was lucky to even get one conversion. Although, it was only an average of 1 a day, I wonder if I'd left the page up for a year, that would've meant 365 wishlists, or more, or less. It fluctuated far more than I expected, considering the only times I promoted the Steam page was when I first put it up. 

But why was the wishlist count so abysmal? Likely due to the page itself, in particular the screenshots and the trailer. The problem with the trailer, is that it simply jumped around too much. I recorded it with the camera turned on, which is enjoyable in gameplay, but not so much when the footage is put at 4x speed. And for the screenshots, I used my laptop which has an irregular resolution that Steam didn’t like and was too lazy to fix the black bars. 

Another problem with the screenshots is that they weren't actually up to date, and still aren't (and will likely never be). Getting screenshots and then scaling them according to the desired resolution is finnicky to do on my computer, so I simply used screenshots I'd taken during development. I don't think it's noticeable to potential players though - the main problem was the aspect ratio.

The page also suffered from an identity crisis - people struggled to understand the unique mechanic, especially when they were unfamiliar with the auto-chess genre. The 'gimmick' of the game was that you had to cycle through the shop to find the towers you liked, rather than have all towers available from the side bar as in BTD6. I also had more towers than BTD6 (excluding their heroes), which was a selling point that I could've emphasised more. 

Overall, pretty pathetic stats, but not surprising. I really believe that if the page looked better, the natural advertising from Steam would've been enough to snowball it into a few more wishlists. Of course, however, the aesthetics limited the success of the store page. Despite it's shortcomings, I've definitely seen worse Steam pages...

This is what I learned from this:

-	Prioritise graphics (no one will read the descriptions)
-	Highlight the ‘gimmick’, or what makes your game unique
-	Make sure the screenshots are visually distinct and eye-catching
-	Put the page up as soon as possible

Marketing.

Often a game's failure is linked to its poor marketing, and this is no different. I was completely aware that I was speaking into the void on twitter, yet I made no attempt to diversify other than a few Reddit posts and a message on the Discord. I also ended up sending a few keys to streamers but after release, I didn’t hear back from one. This is likely because of the release date, which I will discuss more in a minute.

The thing is with marketing - I don't really enjoy it. I was content with the *somewhat* positive reception from the people who did play it, and it's likely my next game won't have much more marketing. The absolute last thing I wanted to do was spend more money on marketing, and since game dev was just a hobby for me, I didn't need the game to be super successful, or even turn a profit, because ultimately, I enjoyed making it. Despite my non-existent marketing, I still expected the game to be successful by being played on a few YouTube channels; notably, Olexa, Retromation, Wanderbots, and Northernlion. There's a few reasons why it wasn't played by these guys but I believe it came down to the release date and the aesthetic.

The game was released on the 16th of June, 3 days before the Steam Next Fest. I pretty much shot myself in the foot for releasing it at this time, because the roguelike market became super over-crowded with free, experimental games that were being actively promoted by Steam. I didn't want to release a demo of the game because I just wanted it to be done with it and I didn't know Next Fest was just around the corner. Releasing a demo first would've quickly ironed out some of the peculiar bugs and game crashes that were in the game on launch due to lacklustre efforts to get playtesters. It also meant I would've built more wishlists pre-launch, which is really the only time they're going to convert. 

The YouTubers who might've played the game became instantly overwhelmed with hundreds of other cool roguelikes from the Next Fest, and their attention diverted to finding and playing demos exclusively. The Next Fest is an amazing opportunity for burgeoning developers to get a playerbase and feedback on their game before releasing it and it's genuinely absurd that I didn't take advantage of that. 

My learnings from this were:

-	Don’t expect content creators to play your game, even if it falls in their niche
-	Release a demo to build a playerbase
-	Take advantage of Steam promotion

Launch

And so, I pressed the release button. So, there's a couple of metrics that are worth discussing. Most interesting, of course, is the financial aspect, so let's get into that.
Even though I was expecting (and hoping) to break even, I was still relatively happy with release. There's a couple of things that immediately stand out that aren't great, but let's first focus on the positives. Gross revenue of $139 USD is pretty cool. $99 net is also ok, I don't think I can take it out until I get $100 but I'm hoping I can make at least one more sale. That's $99 before Steam's 30% cut, but also before conversion to my local currency. After all that, I come away with about $98 aud. A total profit of -$137, after paying for the soundtrack and the Steam Direct Fee. 52 people bought the game, which is kind of hard to believe considering the marketing.
Sales obviously peaked at the start and pretty quickly dropped off.

Another positive is the wishlists jumped up on release a fair bit. Although not listed there, the conversion rate was ~1.5% which is probably two sales. More emails on sale are always a good thing, as games can get lost pretty easily in Steam sales as you'd expect. 

Probably the most glaring parts of the stats are the median time played, and the units returned. I was really disappointed with these metrics, because it related directly to the quality of the game. First, let's talk about refunds. 

So, here they are. Some of it is a bit bullshit. Frame rate too low and system requirements not met are a bit absurd. The game runs at a consistent 60 fps on a toaster, I presume someone just wanted a refund and chose a random option. 

4 instances of ‘not fun’ was pretty disheartening. None of these users wrote notes about what they didn't enjoy, which would've been helpful. Of course, if they didn't enjoy the game they have every right to refund it. I will speculate a bit on this later on when I talk about the game itself, and I've reached the conclusion that the game probably just isn't engaging enough for a significant portion of people. I suspected a lot of people also didn't find the game fun but didn't return it out of pity.
2 instances of ‘other issues’ is completely justified. On launch the game was glitchy and buggy and that was completely preventable. Struggling to find players willing to test, I eventually just said 'fuck it' and released it hoping that Steam players would playtest for me. I did have the foresight to set up a system where I automatically collected crash reports though, which I 100% recommend.  

Finally, 1 instance of ‘game too difficult’ was a bit surprising. I think this just came from someone who wasn't willing to invest the time to get good at the game. Fair enough I guess, I definitely could've made the game a little easier to accommodate for these types of players but oh well.

21.2%, almost a quarter, of sales were refunded. Other developers have different refund rates of course, but in comparison to pretty much all sources, this is substantially above average. Most developers are quoting about 5-7%. Pretty disappointing, but lesson learned - make a better game.

Now let’s see the playtime stats. The 13 people who played it for 1-10 minutes likely either played it for a second and lost interest, or just didn't play it at all. Then we move to 10-20 minutes - this is likely people who played it maybe once or twice and lost a run as well as their interest. It's definitely not an easy game for a beginner. It then falls off substantially with only a few people between 1 hour and 2 hours. 

What's most interesting here is the 200+ minute bracket. I had two friends play the game for long enough to end up in the 200+ bracket however there were five people in total on that end of the spectrum. It's possible they could've left it idle, but I don't really see that happening because the game doesn't pause automatically in the background. This is actually pretty cool because it does sort of line up with some of the harder achievements in the game, namely VICTORY++++, which is beating the game on the highest difficulty. ~4% of players have this achievement, or 2 people. Considering I don't know either of these people, that's pretty cool people enjoyed the game enough to play some of the most difficult and unfair parts for so long!

My takeaways here are:
-	Don’t expect to make a profit
-	Try to make the game enticing from the get-go
-	Add incentives to keep players engaged

Criticism.

At this point, the game hadn’t hit the magic number of 10 wishlists, and I doubt it ever would. It had four user reviews, all of which were positive and very generous. I think they aptly sum up the positives of bugTDX and there's not much point in reiterating them because this post-mortem isn't supposed to be an advertisment - it's supposed to be an analysis and critique. So, let's get into some of the biggest flaws of the game.

What deterred most from bugTDX is the art. It just looks bad. It's not cohesive or consistent. On top of that, the pixellated look worked on some towers quite well to hide lazy design, but it made a lot of the bugs look really odd. The slugs in particular didn't have a thick enough outline, so they'd often just look like little green turds moving along the track. 

The difficulty curve for the game is kind of a squiggly line that jumps up and falls down every time new towers enter the shop which makes it confusing for players to identify which towers are good and which aren't. On top of that, despite having stats available to the player, they were unintuitive and unhelpful. I think having the stats was a failed experiment, and it's more fun for the player to only get the stats that are unique to towers, like lightning chance or fire damage. 

In hindsight, I would’ve created the game in such a way where each tower could store how much damage it had done over the wave so it’s clearer to players which towers are more valuable. This the obvious way to develop a game like this, but since I was new to game development, I didn't think of it. 

Having a system like this would've made the game much easier to balance. But instead, I let the game be confusingly balanced, and never told the player if they were doing well or not.

A selling point of bugTDX is its 40+ towers (45 in total from memory), which I was pretty proud of. However, introducing a huge potential pool of towers also introduces problems that fundamentally alter the game and make it simply less enjoyable. Games like The Binding of Isaac can get away with item bloat (having too many items) because the items aren't often stacked so you *want* unique items each time. In bugTDX, success requires having towers of high level, which means you need multiple instances of the same tower to level them up. It's way too RNG based for my liking, and I think it really impacts my enjoyment of a run because I feel like I'm being penalised by attempting to level a tower up because there's no immediate incentive. Furthermore, as the run progresses and the tower pool grows, the shop space does not. You are constantly bound to three spots in the shop despite the huge increase of towers. Three spots often feel too few for even the first few rounds with a pool of about 11 towers, so the problem just gets worse over time.

Additionally, it's hard to admit, but bugTDX can be boring. I normally play it while watching TV, but it can be incredibly dull if your attention is focused solely on the game because during a wave there just isn't much to do. The speed of the game was bound to pretty much 1x because otherwise a projectile would be on one side of the enemies on one frame, and on the other side on the next frame. So, when there was a particularly long wave, or your strategy was dependent on one of the many support towers that slowed enemies, you'd just have to sit there. Inactivity is *never* fun and players always need something to do, even if it's just menial clicking buttons. 

There were plenty of ways for me to give the player something to do during those waves but unfortunately once you become numb to the once satisfying particle explosions, you're impatient and probably unhappy with the game.

And at this point, bugTDX doesn’t offer enough incentive for players to return. I've always been sceptical of battle passes and unlockable cosmetics, but they’re an important aspect of developing a game that keeps players coming back. Players need visible goals to strive for that isn't just 'beat the game', as well as rewards with these goals. A good thing about roguelites in particular, is that after each run you probably have some currency and some know-how to help you progress further in the next run, so the difficulty curve as you get better is way steeper. 

In bugTDX, there needed to be incentive for players to get further in the game. A good example is the huge, locked screen in Brotato of all of the different characters that require unlocking. I could have showed the players all the different difficulties that remained behind locked doors, or catalogue of all the towers you’d won with to keep you coming back. Giving the player an incentive to play again - especially in a genre as inherently punishing as roguelikes - is fundamental to converting new players to established players. 

And another massive issue, that I almost never see indie developers address, is how fucking annoying UI is. All buttons in bugTDX are just floating bits of text that would grey out when you hover over them. To be inspired by SNKRX but not bring over any of the UI design that made that game so satisfying to play is pretty embarrassing. 
Text constantly overlapped, the UI felt incredibly rudimentary, and unintuitive. Oftentimes people would forget they had a tower locked in their shop because the only visual indication that it was, would be this little text here said ‘unfreeze’, instead of ‘freeze’.

Then there's the issue with space on the screen. Turns out the game, by default, would start super zoomed out, and players would have no reason to adjust this for themselves. So, there was a lot of unused screen space, and the odd pixelated graphics were made even worse by being zoomed out. 

And so, my game-design lessons here were:

-	Doing anything should be satisfying
-	Players should want to keep playing
-	Players should always have something to do
-	Graphics are vastly superior to gameplay if you want to get people in the door

And this is where I thought the devlog was over. I made about 100 bucks, whatever, time to move on. But not quite.

Olexa.
So, one morning I wake up early and pull out my laptop. I opened up YouTube, and right there, on my home page, is ‘This New Tower Defense Autobattler is Pure Sneaky Fun’, a playthrough by Olexa. To say I was stunned is an understatement. I’d long given up hope after hearing back nothing from my emails, and so I wasn’t even checking for new videos on the game anymore. 

And not only did he play the game, but he enjoyed it! He recommended it to Retromation, who played it a few days afterwards to his audience. Olexa’s video is currently sitting at 73k views. I have no clue why it performed so well, but I don’t mind that it did.

The highest sales I’d ever had in a day was 14 – the day of release. The day Olexa’s video came out, the game sold 135 copies, becoming profitable overnight. Not only that, but the wishlists jumped to 600, which meant more people would buy the game in future sales and events.

I hit the 10-review mark and surpassed it. It’s currently sitting at 22 reviews. Here’s the graph for the visits on bugTDX’s store page over time, can you guess when it hit 10 reviews?

My first payout was $1700 USD, and I remember seeing it in my bank account and just feeling so accomplished. I mean, still, it’s not that much money in comparison to games like SNKRX, or even other niche roguelikes, but it was a profit and I had earnt it. 

I am so incredibly grateful to Olexa for playing bugTDX and giving it a chance and going on to recommend it to Retromation. I’ve noticed certain other content creators don’t tend to put links to the game in their video’s description, and instead just focus on the game. But Olexa and Retromation are constantly doing their best to showcase good games, whilst making sure the developers get the recognition they deserve. Not many other creators would try a game like bugTDX. 

I released heaps of updates for the game to fix all the crashes and bugs that popped up from the influx of new players. But I soon realised that it was simply impossible to fix all the issues I had with the game. At the end of the day, it was fundamentally flawed, both aesthetically, and by design. Plus, there were parts of the game that were so overwhelmingly broken, that it’d take me days to rewrite a system just to fix it. I made the repository for bugTDX public just recently, so feel free to check it out. The code was an unfixable mess, but I had so much more I wanted to add to the game. Plus, I wanted to ride off the success of the YouTube coverage, but I just couldn’t.

Smells fishy.

So, I started something else. Something big. During the university break I began piecing together another idea I had. I wanted to expand on bugTDX and create a game that was a million times better. Although, I didn’t know it at the time, this game would make me quit my job. This game would push me to my limits. And, in my dreams, this game would propel me into indie success.

But that’s a story for next video. Subscribe to watch it when it comes out, and like the video to please the algorithm. I definitely recommend buying bugTDX, it’s literally $3, so you can see it for yourself. And here, for the final shot, is the lifetime stats for bugTDX.

Thanks for watching and I’ll see you in the next one.
